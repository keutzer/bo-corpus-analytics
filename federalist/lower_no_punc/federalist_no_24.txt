the powers necessary to the common defense further considered for the independent journal wednesday december 19 1787 to the people of the state of new york to the powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal government in respect to the creation and direction of the national forces i have met with but one specific objection which if i understand it right is this that proper provision has not been made against the existence of standing armies in time of peace an objection which i shall now endeavor to show rests on weak and unsubstantial foundations it has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general form supported only by bold assertions without the appearance of argument without even the sanction of theoretical opinions in contradiction to the practice of other free nations and to the general sense of america as expressed in most of the existing constitutions the proprietary of this remark will appear the moment it is recollected that the objection under consideration turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the legislative authority of the nation in the article of military establishments a principle unheard of except in one or two of our state constitutions and rejected in all the rest a stranger to our politics who was to read our newspapers at the present juncture without having previously inspected the plan reported by the convention would be naturally led to one of two conclusions either that it contained a positive injunction that standing armies should be kept up in time of peace or that it vested in the executive the whole power of levying troops without subjecting his discretion in any shape to the control of the legislature if he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself he would be surprised to discover that neither the one nor the other was the case that the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the legislature not in the executive that this legislature was to be a popular body consisting of the representatives of the people periodically elected and that instead of the provision he had supposed in favor of standing armies there was to be found in respect to this object an important qualification even of the legislative discretion in that clause which forbids the appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer period than two years a precaution which upon a nearer view of it will appear to be a great and real security against the keeping up of troops without evident necessity disappointed in his first surmise the person i have supposed would be apt to pursue his conjectures a little further he would naturally say to himself it is impossible that all this vehement and pathetic declamation can be without some colorable pretext it must needs be that this people so jealous of their liberties have in all the preceding models of the constitutions which they have established inserted the most precise and rigid precautions on this point the omission of which in the new plan has given birth to all this apprehension and clamor if under this impression he proceeded to pass in review the several state constitutions how great would be his disappointment to find that two only of them1 contained an interdiction of standing armies in time of peace that the other eleven had either observed a profound silence on the subject or had in express terms admitted the right of the legislature to authorize their existence still however he would be persuaded that there must be some plausible foundation for the cry raised on this head he would never be able to imagine while any source of information remained unexplored that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the public credulity dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be ingenuous it would probably occur to him that he would be likely to find the precautions he was in search of in the primitive compact between the states here at length he would expect to meet with a solution of the enigma no doubt he would observe to himself the existing confederation must contain the most explicit provisions against military establishments in time of peace and a departure from this model in a favorite point has occasioned the discontent which appears to influence these political champions if he should now apply himself to a careful and critical survey of the articles of confederation his astonishment would not only be increased but would acquire a mixture of indignation at the unexpected discovery that these articles instead of containing the prohibition he looked for and though they had with jealous circumspection restricted the authority of the state legislatures in this particular had not imposed a single restraint on that of the united states if he happened to be a man of quick sensibility or ardent temper he could now no longer refrain from regarding these clamors as the dishonest artifices of a sinister and unprincipled opposition to a plan which ought at least to receive a fair and candid examination from all sincere lovers of their country how else he would say could the authors of them have been tempted to vent such loud censures upon that plan about a point in which it seems to have conformed itself to the general sense of america as declared in its different forms of government and in which it has even superadded a new and powerful guard unknown to any of them if on the contrary he happened to be a man of calm and dispassionate feelings he would indulge a sigh for the frailty of human nature and would lament that in a matter so interesting to the happiness of millions the true merits of the question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients so unfriendly to an impartial and right determination even such a man could hardly forbear remarking that a conduct of this kind has too much the appearance of an intention to mislead the people by alarming their passions rather than to convince them by arguments addressed to their understandings but however little this objection may be countenanced even by precedents among ourselves it may be satisfactory to take a nearer view of its intrinsic merits from a close examination it will appear that restraints upon the discretion of the legislature in respect to military establishments in time of peace would be improper to be imposed and if imposed from the necessities of society would be unlikely to be observed though a wide ocean separates the united states from europe yet there are various considerations that warn us against an excess of confidence or security on one side of us and stretching far into our rear are growing settlements subject to the dominion of britain on the other side and extending to meet the british settlements are colonies and establishments subject to the dominion of spain this situation and the vicinity of the west india islands belonging to these two powers create between them in respect to their american possessions and in relation to us a common interest the savage tribes on our western frontier ought to be regarded as our natural enemies their natural allies because they have most to fear from us and most to hope from them the improvements in the art of navigation have as to the facility of communication rendered distant nations in a great measure neighbors britain and spain are among the principal maritime powers of europe a future concert of views between these nations ought not to be regarded as improbable the increasing remoteness of consanguinity is every day diminishing the force of the family compact between france and spain and politicians have ever with great reason considered the ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of political connection these circumstances combined admonish us not to be too sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the reach of danger previous to the revolution and ever since the peace there has been a constant necessity for keeping small garrisons on our western frontier no person can doubt that these will continue to be indispensable if it should only be against the ravages and depredations of the indians these garrisons must either be furnished by occasional detachments from the militia or by permanent corps in the pay of the government the first is impracticable and if practicable would be pernicious the militia would not long if at all submit to be dragged from their occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in times of profound peace and if they could be prevailed upon or compelled to do it the increased expense of a frequent rotation of service and the loss of labor and disconcertion of the industrious pursuits of individuals would form conclusive objections to the scheme it would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as ruinous to private citizens the latter resource of permanent corps in the pay of the government amounts to a standing army in time of peace a small one indeed but not the less real for being small here is a simple view of the subject that shows us at once the impropriety of a constitutional interdiction of such establishments and the necessity of leaving the matter to the discretion and prudence of the legislature in proportion to our increase in strength it is probable nay it may be said certain that britain and spain would augment their military establishments in our neighborhood if we should not be willing to be exposed in a naked and defenseless condition to their insults and encroachments we should find it expedient to increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which our western settlements might be annoyed there are and will be particular posts the possession of which will include the command of large districts of territory and facilitate future invasions of the remainder it may be added that some of those posts will be keys to the trade with the indian nations can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers to act this part would be to desert all the usual maxims of prudence and policy if we mean to be a commercial people or even to be secure on our atlantic side we must endeavor as soon as possible to have a navy to this purpose there must be dockyards and arsenals and for the defense of these fortifications and probably garrisons when a nation has become so powerful by sea that it can protect its dockyards by its fleets this supersedes the necessity of garrisons for that purpose but where naval establishments are in their infancy moderate garrisons will in all likelihood be found an indispensable security against descents for the destruction of the arsenals and dockyards and sometimes of the fleet itself publius 1 this statement of the matter is taken from the printed collection of state constitutions pennsylvania and north carolina are the two which contain the interdiction in these words as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty they ought not to be kept up this is in truth rather a caution than a prohibition new hampshire massachusetts delaware and maryland have in each of their bils of rights a clause to this effect standing armies are dangerous to liberty and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature which is a formal admission of the authority of the legislature new york has no bills of rights and her constitution says not a word about the matter no bills of rights appear annexed to the constitutions of the other states except the foregoing and their constitutions are equally silent i am told however that one or two states have bills of rights which do not appear in this collection but that those also recognize the right of the legislative authority in this respect
