the appointing power continued and other powers of the executive considered from the independent journal wednesday april 2 1788 to the people of the state of new york it has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the cooperation of the senate in the business of appointments that it would contribute to the stability of the administration the consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint a change of the chief magistrate therefore would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected if he were the sole disposer of offices where a man in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it a new president would be restrained from attempting a change in favor of a person more agreeable to him by the apprehension that a discountenance of the senate might frustrate the attempt and bring some degree of discredit upon himself those who can best estimate the value of a steady administration will be most disposed to prize a provision which connects the official existence of public men with the approbation or disapprobation of that body which from the greater permanency of its own composition will in all probability be less subject to inconstancy than any other member of the government to this union of the senate with the president in the article of appointments it has in some cases been suggested that it would serve to give the president an undue influence over the senate and in others that it would have an opposite tendencya strong proof that neither suggestion is true to state the first in its proper form is to refute it it amounts to this the president would have an improper influence over the senate because the senate would have the power of restraining him this is an absurdity in terms it cannot admit of a doubt that the entire power of appointment would enable him much more effectually to establish a dangerous empire over that body than a mere power of nomination subject to their control let us take a view of the converse of the proposition the senate would influence the executive as i have had occasion to remark in several other instances the indistinctness of the objection forbids a precise answer in what manner is this influence to be exerted in relation to what objects the power of influencing a person in the sense in which it is here used must imply a power of conferring a benefit upon him how could the senate confer a benefit upon the president by the manner of employing their right of negative upon his nominations if it be said they might sometimes gratify him by an acquiescence in a favorite choice when public motives might dictate a different conduct i answer that the instances in which the president could be personally interested in the result would be too few to admit of his being materially affected by the compliances of the senate the power which can originate the disposition of honors and emoluments is more likely to attract than to be attracted by the power which can merely obstruct their course if by influencing the president be meant restraining him this is precisely what must have been intended and it has been shown that the restraint would be salutary at the same time that it would not be such as to destroy a single advantage to be looked for from the uncontrolled agency of that magistrate the right of nomination would produce all the good without the ille1 good of that of appointment and would in a great measure avoid its evilse1 upon a comparison of the plan for the appointment of the officers of the proposed government with that which is established by the constitution of this state a decided preference must be given to the former in that plan the power of nomination is unequivocally vested in the executive and as there would be a necessity for submitting each nomination to the judgment of an entire branch of the legislature the circumstances attending an appointment from the mode of conducting it would naturally become matters of notoriety and the public would be at no loss to determine what part had been performed by the different actors the blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the president singly and absolutely the censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the senate aggravated by the consideration of their having counteracted the good intentions of the executive if an ill appointment should be made the executive for nominating and the senate for approving would participate though in different degrees in the opprobrium and disgrace the reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment in this state the council of appointment consists of from three to five persons of whom the governor is always one this small body shut up in a private apartment impenetrable to the public eye proceed to the execution of the trust committed to them it is known that the governor claims the right of nomination upon the strength of some ambiguous expressions in the constitution but it is not known to what extent or in what manner he exercises it nor upon what occasions he is contradicted or opposed the censure of a bad appointment on account of the uncertainty of its author and for want of a determinate object has neither poignancy nor duration and while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open all idea of responsibility is lost the most that the public can know is that the governor claims the right of nomination that two out of the inconsiderable number of four men can too often be managed without much difficulty that if some of the members of a particular council should happen to be of an uncomplying character it is frequently not impossible to get rid of their opposition by regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to render their attendance inconvenient and that from whatever cause it may proceed a great number of very improper appointments are from time to time made whether a governor of this state avails himself of the ascendant he must necessarily have in this delicate and important part of the administration to prefer to offices men who are best qualified for them or whether he prostitutes that advantage to the advancement of persons whose chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will and to the support of a despicable and dangerous system of personal influence are questions which unfortunately for the community can only be the subjects of speculation and conjecture every mere council of appointment however constituted will be a conclave in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope their number without an unwarrantable increase of expense cannot be large enough to preclude a facility of combination and as each member will have his friends and connections to provide for the desire of mutual gratification will beget a scandalous bartering of votes and bargaining for places the private attachments of one man might easily be satisfied but to satisfy the private attachments of a dozen or of twenty men would occasion a monopoly of all the principal employments of the government in a few families and would lead more directly to an aristocracy or an oligarchy than any measure that could be contrived if to avoid an accumulation of offices there was to be a frequent change in the persons who were to compose the council this would involve the mischiefs of a mutable administration in their full extent such a council would also be more liable to executive influence than the senate because they would be fewer in number and would act less immediately under the public inspection such a council in fine as a substitute for the plan of the convention would be productive of an increase of expense a multiplication of the evils which spring from favoritism and intrigue in the distribution of public honors a decrease of stability in the administration of the government and a diminution of the security against an undue influence of the executive and yet such a council has been warmly contended for as an essential amendment in the proposed constitution i could not with propriety conclude my observations on the subject of appointments without taking notice of a scheme for which there have appeared some though but few advocates i mean that of uniting the house of representatives in the power of making them i shall however do little more than mention it as i cannot imagine that it is likely to gain the countenance of any considerable part of the community a body so fluctuating and at the same time so numerous can never be deemed proper for the exercise of that power its unfitness will appear manifest to all when it is recollected that in half a century it may consist of three or four hundred persons all the advantages of the stability both of the executive and of the senate would be defeated by this union and infinite delays and embarrassments would be occasioned the example of most of the states in their local constitutions encourages us to reprobate the idea the only remaining powers of the executive are comprehended in giving information to congress of the state of the union in recommending to their consideration such measures as he shall judge expedient in convening them or either branch upon extraordinary occasions in adjourning them when they cannot themselves agree upon the time of adjournment in receiving ambassadors and other public ministers in faithfully executing the laws and in commissioning all the officers of the united states except some cavils about the power of convening either house of the legislature and that of receiving ambassadors no objection has been made to this class of authorities nor could they possibly admit of any it required indeed an insatiable avidity for censure to invent exceptions to the parts which have been excepted to in regard to the power of convening either house of the legislature i shall barely remark that in respect to the senate at least we can readily discover a good reason for it as this body has a concurrent power with the executive in the article of treaties it might often be necessary to call it together with a view to this object when it would be unnecessary and improper to convene the house of representatives as to the reception of ambassadors what i have said in a former paper will furnish a sufficient answer we have now completed a survey of the structure and powers of the executive department which i have endeavored to show combines as far as republican principles will admit all the requisites to energy the remaining inquiry is does it also combine the requisites to safety in a republican sensea due dependence on the people a due responsibility the answer to this question has been anticipated in the investigation of its other characteristics and is satisfactorily deducible from these circumstances from the election of the president once in four years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that purpose and from his being at all times liable to impeachment trial dismission from office incapacity to serve in any other and to forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common course of law but these precautions great as they are are not the only ones which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the public security in the only instances in which the abuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared the chief magistrate of the united states would by that plan be subjected to the control of a branch of the legislative body what more could be desired by an enlightened and reasonable people publius e1 these two alternate endings of this sentence appear in different editions
