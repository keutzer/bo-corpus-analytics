objections to the proposed constitution from extent of territory answered from the new york packet friday november 30 1787 to the people of the state of new york we have seen the necessity of the union as our bulwark against foreign danger as the conservator of peace among ourselves as the guardian of our commerce and other common interests as the only substitute for those military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the old world and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction which have proved fatal to other popular governments and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by our own all that remains within this branch of our inquiries is to take notice of an objection that may be drawn from the great extent of country which the union embraces a few observations on this subject will be the more proper as it is perceived that the adversaries of the new constitution are availing themselves of the prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere of republican administration in order to supply by imaginary difficulties the want of those solid objections which they endeavor in vain to find the error which limits republican government to a narrow district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers i remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter the true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion it is that in a democracy the people meet and exercise the government in person in a republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents a democracy consequently will be confined to a small spot a republic may be extended over a large region to this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of some celebrated authors whose writings have had a great share in forming the modern standard of political opinions being subjects either of an absolute or limited monarchy they have endeavored to heighten the advantages or palliate the evils of those forms by placing in comparison the vices and defects of the republican and by citing as specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient greece and modern italy under the confusion of names it has been an easy task to transfer to a republic observations applicable to a democracy only and among others the observation that it can never be established but among a small number of people living within a small compass of territory such a fallacy may have been the less perceived as most of the popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic species and even in modern europe to which we owe the great principle of representation no example is seen of a government wholly popular and founded at the same time wholly on that principle if europe has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in government by the simple agency of which the will of the largest political body may be concentred and its force directed to any object which the public good requires america can claim the merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive republics it is only to be lamented that any of her citizens should wish to deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full efficacy in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her consideration as the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand and will include no greater number than can join in those functions so the natural limit of a republic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the administration of public affairs can it be said that the limits of the united states exceed this distance it will not be said by those who recollect that the atlantic coast is the longest side of the union that during the term of thirteen years the representatives of the states have been almost continually assembled and that the members from the most distant states are not chargeable with greater intermissions of attendance than those from the states in the neighborhood of congress that we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting subject let us resort to the actual dimensions of the union the limits as fixed by the treaty of peace are on the east the atlantic on the south the latitude of thirtyone degrees on the west the mississippi and on the north an irregular line running in some instances beyond the fortyfifth degree in others falling as low as the fortysecond the southern shore of lake erie lies below that latitude computing the distance between the thirtyfirst and fortyfifth degrees it amounts to nine hundred and seventythree common miles computing it from thirtyone to fortytwo degrees to seven hundred and sixtyfour miles and a half taking the mean for the distance the amount will be eight hundred and sixtyeight miles and threefourths the mean distance from the atlantic to the mississippi does not probably exceed seven hundred and fifty miles on a comparison of this extent with that of several countries in europe the practicability of rendering our system commensurate to it appears to be demonstrable it is not a great deal larger than germany where a diet representing the whole empire is continually assembled or than poland before the late dismemberment where another national diet was the depositary of the supreme power passing by france and spain we find that in great britain inferior as it may be in size the representatives of the northern extremity of the island have as far to travel to the national council as will be required of those of the most remote parts of the union favorable as this view of the subject may be some observations remain which will place it in a light still more satisfactory in the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects which concern all the members of the republic but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any the subordinate governments which can extend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately provided for will retain their due authority and activity were it proposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of the particular states its adversaries would have some ground for their objection though it would not be difficult to show that if they were abolished the general government would be compelled by the principle of selfpreservation to reinstate them in their proper jurisdiction a second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the federal constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive states which we know to be practicable and to add to them such other states as may arise in their own bosoms or in their neighborhoods which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable the arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which lie on our northwestern frontier must be left to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more equal to the task let it be remarked in the third place that the intercourse throughout the union will be facilitated by new improvements roads will everywhere be shortened and kept in better order accommodations for travelers will be multiplied and meliorated an interior navigation on our eastern side will be opened throughout or nearly throughout the whole extent of the thirteen states the communication between the western and atlantic districts and between different parts of each will be rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has intersected our country and which art finds it so little difficult to connect and complete a fourth and still more important consideration is that as almost every state will on one side or other be a frontier and will thus find in regard to its safety an inducement to make some sacrifices for the sake of the general protection so the states which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the union and which of course may partake least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits will be at the same time immediately contiguous to foreign nations and will consequently stand on particular occasions in greatest need of its strength and resources it may be inconvenient for georgia or the states forming our western or northeastern borders to send their representatives to the seat of government but they would find it more so to struggle alone against an invading enemy or even to support alone the whole expense of those precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual danger if they should derive less benefit therefore from the union in some respects than the less distant states they will derive greater benefit from it in other respects and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained throughout i submit to you my fellowcitizens these considerations in full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions will allow them their due weight and effect and that you will never suffer difficulties however formidable in appearance or however fashionable the error on which they may be founded to drive you into the gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion would conduct you hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of america knit together as they are by so many cords of affection can no longer live together as members of the same family can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness can no longer be fellow citizens of one great respectable and flourishing empire hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors that it rashly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish no my countrymen shut your ears against this unhallowed language shut your hearts against the poison which it conveys the kindred blood which flows in the veins of american citizens the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their sacred rights consecrate their union and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens rivals enemies and if novelties are to be shunned believe me the most alarming of all novelties the most wild of all projects the most rash of all attempts is that of rendering us in pieces in order to preserve our liberties and promote our happiness but why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected merely because it may comprise what is new is it not the glory of the people of america that whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity for custom or for names to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense the knowledge of their own situation and the lessons of their own experience to this manly spirit posterity will be indebted for the possession and the world for the example of the numerous innovations displayed on the american theatre in favor of private rights and public happiness had no important step been taken by the leaders of the revolution for which a precedent could not be discovered no government established of which an exact model did not present itself the people of the united states might at this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of misguided councils must at best have been laboring under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind happily for america happily we trust for the whole human race they pursued a new and more noble course they accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society they reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe they formed the design of a great confederacy which it is incumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate if their works betray imperfections we wonder at the fewness of them if they erred most in the structure of the union this was the work most difficult to be executed this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide publius
