the conformity of the plan to republican principles for the independent journal wednesday january 16 1788 to the people of the state of new york the last paper having concluded the observations which were meant to introduce a candid survey of the plan of government reported by the convention we now proceed to the execution of that part of our undertaking the first question that offers itself is whether the general form and aspect of the government be strictly republican it is evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of america with the fundamental principles of the revolution or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for selfgovernment if the plan of the convention therefore be found to depart from the republican character its advocates must abandon it as no longer defensible what then are the distinctive characters of the republican form were an answer to this question to be sought not by recurring to principles but in the application of the term by political writers to the constitution of different states no satisfactory one would ever be found holland in which no particle of the supreme authority is derived from the people has passed almost universally under the denomination of a republic the same title has been bestowed on venice where absolute power over the great body of the people is exercised in the most absolute manner by a small body of hereditary nobles poland which is a mixture of aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms has been dignified with the same appellation the government of england which has one republican branch only combined with an hereditary aristocracy and monarchy has with equal impropriety been frequently placed on the list of republics these examples which are nearly as dissimilar to each other as to a genuine republic show the extreme inaccuracy with which the term has been used in political disquisitions if we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which different forms of government are established we may define a republic to be or at least may bestow that name on a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure for a limited period or during good behavior it is essential to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society not from an inconsiderable proportion or a favored class of it otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers might aspire to the rank of republicans and claim for their government the honorable title of republic it is sufficient for such a government that the persons administering it be appointed either directly or indirectly by the people and that they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just specified otherwise every government in the united states as well as every other popular government that has been or can be well organized or well executed would be degraded from the republican character according to the constitution of every state in the union some or other of the officers of government are appointed indirectly only by the people according to most of them the chief magistrate himself is so appointed and according to one this mode of appointment is extended to one of the coordinate branches of the legislature according to all the constitutions also the tenure of the highest offices is extended to a definite period and in many instances both within the legislative and executive departments to a period of years according to the provisions of most of the constitutions again as well as according to the most respectable and received opinions on the subject the members of the judiciary department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good behavior on comparing the constitution planned by the convention with the standard here fixed we perceive at once that it is in the most rigid sense conformable to it the house of representatives like that of one branch at least of all the state legislatures is elected immediately by the great body of the people the senate like the present congress and the senate of maryland derives its appointment indirectly from the people the president is indirectly derived from the choice of the people according to the example in most of the states even the judges with all other officers of the union will as in the several states be the choice though a remote choice of the people themselves the duration of the appointments is equally conformable to the republican standard and to the model of state constitutions the house of representatives is periodically elective as in all the states and for the period of two years as in the state of south carolina the senate is elective for the period of six years which is but one year more than the period of the senate of maryland and but two more than that of the senates of new york and virginia the president is to continue in office for the period of four years as in new york and delaware the chief magistrate is elected for three years and in south carolina for two years in the other states the election is annual in several of the states however no constitutional provision is made for the impeachment of the chief magistrate and in delaware and virginia he is not impeachable till out of office the president of the united states is impeachable at any time during his continuance in office the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places is as it unquestionably ought to be that of good behavior the tenure of the ministerial offices generally will be a subject of legal regulation conformably to the reason of the case and the example of the state constitutions could any further proof be required of the republican complexion of this system the most decisive one might be found in its absolute prohibition of titles of nobility both under the federal and the state governments and in its express guaranty of the republican form to each of the latter but it was not sufficient say the adversaries of the proposed constitution for the convention to adhere to the republican form they ought with equal care to have preserved the federal form which regards the union as a confederacy of sovereign states instead of which they have framed a national government which regards the union as a consolidation of the states and it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken the handle which has been made of this objection requires that it should be examined with some precision without inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which the objection is founded it will be necessary to a just estimate of its force first to ascertain the real character of the government in question secondly to inquire how far the convention were authorized to propose such a government and thirdly how far the duty they owed to their country could supply any defect of regular authority first in order to ascertain the real character of the government it may be considered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be established to the sources from which its ordinary powers are to be drawn to the operation of those powers to the extent of them and to the authority by which future changes in the government are to be introduced on examining the first relation it appears on one hand that the constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the people of america given by deputies elected for the special purpose but on the other that this assent and ratification is to be given by the people not as individuals composing one entire nation but as composing the distinct and independent states to which they respectively belong it is to be the assent and ratification of the several states derived from the supreme authority in each state the authority of the people themselves the act therefore establishing the constitution will not be a national but a federal act that it will be a federal and not a national act as these terms are understood by the objectors the act of the people as forming so many independent states not as forming one aggregate nation is obvious from this single consideration that it is to result neither from the decision of a majority of the people of the union nor from that of a majority of the states it must result from the unanimous assent of the several states that are parties to it differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed not by the legislative authority but by that of the people themselves were the people regarded in this transaction as forming one nation the will of the majority of the whole people of the united states would bind the minority in the same manner as the majority in each state must bind the minority and the will of the majority must be determined either by a comparison of the individual votes or by considering the will of the majority of the states as evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the united states neither of these rules have been adopted each state in ratifying the constitution is considered as a sovereign body independent of all others and only to be bound by its own voluntary act in this relation then the new constitution will if established be a federal and not a national constitution the next relation is to the sources from which the ordinary powers of government are to be derived the house of representatives will derive its powers from the people of america and the people will be represented in the same proportion and on the same principle as they are in the legislature of a particular state so far the government is national not federal the senate on the other hand will derive its powers from the states as political and coequal societies and these will be represented on the principle of equality in the senate as they now are in the existing congress so far the government is federal not national the executive power will be derived from a very compound source the immediate election of the president is to be made by the states in their political characters the votes allotted to them are in a compound ratio which considers them partly as distinct and coequal societies partly as unequal members of the same society the eventual election again is to be made by that branch of the legislature which consists of the national representatives but in this particular act they are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations from so many distinct and coequal bodies politic from this aspect of the government it appears to be of a mixed character presenting at least as many federal as national features the difference between a federal and national government as it relates to the operation of the government is supposed to consist in this that in the former the powers operate on the political bodies composing the confederacy in their political capacities in the latter on the individual citizens composing the nation in their individual capacities on trying the constitution by this criterion it falls under the national not the federal character though perhaps not so completely as has been understood in several cases and particularly in the trial of controversies to which states may be parties they must be viewed and proceeded against in their collective and political capacities only so far the national countenance of the government on this side seems to be disfigured by a few federal features but this blemish is perhaps unavoidable in any plan and the operation of the government on the people in their individual capacities in its ordinary and most essential proceedings may on the whole designate it in this relation a national government but if the government be national with regard to the operation of its powers it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation to the extent of its powers the idea of a national government involves in it not only an authority over the individual citizens but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things so far as they are objects of lawful government among a people consolidated into one nation this supremacy is completely vested in the national legislature among communities united for particular purposes it is vested partly in the general and partly in the municipal legislatures in the former case all local authorities are subordinate to the supreme and may be controlled directed or abolished by it at pleasure in the latter the local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy no more subject within their respective spheres to the general authority than the general authority is subject to them within its own sphere in this relation then the proposed government cannot be deemed a national one since its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only and leaves to the several states a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects it is true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions the tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be established under the general government but this does not change the principle of the case the decision is to be impartially made according to the rules of the constitution and all the usual and most effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the compact and that it ought to be established under the general rather than under the local governments or to speak more properly that it could be safely established under the first alone is a position not likely to be combated if we try the constitution by its last relation to the authority by which amendments are to be made we find it neither wholly national nor wholly federal were it wholly national the supreme and ultimate authority would reside in the majority of the people of the union and this authority would be competent at all times like that of a majority of every national society to alter or abolish its established government were it wholly federal on the other hand the concurrence of each state in the union would be essential to every alteration that would be binding on all the mode provided by the plan of the convention is not founded on either of these principles in requiring more than a majority and principles in requiring more than a majority and particularly in computing the proportion by states not by citizens it departs from the national and advances towards the federal character in rendering the concurrence of less than the whole number of states sufficient it loses again the federal and partakes of the national character the proposed constitution therefore is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution but a composition of both in its foundation it is federal not national in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the government are drawn it is partly federal and partly national in the operation of these powers it is national not federal in the extent of them again it is federal not national and finally in the authoritative mode of introducing amendments it is neither wholly federal nor wholly national publius
