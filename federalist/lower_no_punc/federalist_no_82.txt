the judiciary continued from mcleans edition new york wednesday may 28 1788 to the people of the state of new york the erection of a new government whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety and these may in a particular manner be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties tis time only that can mature and perfect so compound a system can liquidate the meaning of all the parts and can adjust them to each other in a harmonious and consistent whole such questions accordingly have arisen upon the plan proposed by the convention and particularly concerning the judiciary department the principal of these respect the situation of the state courts in regard to those causes which are to be submitted to federal jurisdiction is this to be exclusive or are those courts to possess a concurrent jurisdiction if the latter in what relation will they stand to the national tribunals these are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense and which are certainly entitled to attention the principles established in a former paper1 teach us that the states will retain all preexisting authorities which may not be exclusively delegated to the federal head and that this exclusive delegation can only exist in one of three cases where an exclusive authority is in express terms granted to the union or where a particular authority is granted to the union and the exercise of a like authority is prohibited to the states or where an authority is granted to the union with which a similar authority in the states would be utterly incompatible though these principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative power yet i am inclined to think that they are in the main just with respect to the former as well as the latter and under this impression i shall lay it down as a rule that the state courts will retain the jurisdiction they now have unless it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes the only thing in the proposed constitution which wears the appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts is contained in this passage the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress shall from time to time ordain and establish this might either be construed to signify that the supreme and subordinate courts of the union should alone have the power of deciding those causes to which their authority is to extend or simply to denote that the organs of the national judiciary should be one supreme court and as many subordinate courts as congress should think proper to appoint or in other words that the united states should exercise the judicial power with which they are to be invested through one supreme tribunal and a certain number of inferior ones to be instituted by them the first excludes the last admits the concurrent jurisdiction of the state tribunals and as the first would amount to an alienation of state power by implication the last appears to me the most natural and the most defensible construction but this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly applicable to those descriptions of causes of which the state courts have previous cognizance it is not equally evident in relation to cases which may grow out of and be peculiar to the constitution to be established for not to allow the state courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases can hardly be considered as the abridgment of a preexisting authority i mean not therefore to contend that the united states in the course of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their direction may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the federal courts solely if such a measure should be deemed expedient but i hold that the state courts will be divested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction further than may relate to an appeal and i am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth this i infer from the nature of judiciary power and from the general genius of the system the judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe those of japan not less than of new york may furnish the objects of legal discussion to our courts when in addition to this we consider the state governments and the national governments as they truly are in the light of kindred systems and as parts of one whole the inference seems to be conclusive that the state courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws of the union where it was not expressly prohibited here another question occurs what relation would subsist between the national and state courts in these instances of concurrent jurisdiction i answer that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter to the supreme court of the united states the constitution in direct terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court in all the enumerated cases of federal cognizance in which it is not to have an original one without a single expression to confine its operation to the inferior federal courts the objects of appeal not the tribunals from which it is to be made are alone contemplated from this circumstance and from the reason of the thing it ought to be construed to extend to the state tribunals either this must be the case or the local courts must be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national concern else the judiciary authority of the union may be eluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor neither of these consequences ought without evident necessity to be involved the latter would be entirely inadmissible as it would defeat some of the most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government and would essentially embarrass its measures nor do i perceive any foundation for such a supposition agreeably to the remark already made the national and state systems are to be regarded as one whole the courts of the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the union and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles of national justice and the rules of national decisions the evident aim of the plan of the convention is that all the causes of the specified classes shall for weighty public reasons receive their original or final determination in the courts of the union to confine therefore the general expressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court to appeals from the subordinate federal courts instead of allowing their extension to the state courts would be to abridge the latitude of the terms in subversion of the intent contrary to every sound rule of interpretation but could an appeal be made to lie from the state courts to the subordinate federal judicatories this is another of the questions which have been raised and of greater difficulty than the former the following considerations countenance the affirmative the plan of the convention in the first place authorizes the national legislature to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court2 it declares in the next place that the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as congress shall ordain and establish and it then proceeds to enumerate the cases to which this judicial power shall extend it afterwards divides the jurisdiction of the supreme court into original and appellate but gives no definition of that of the subordinate courts the only outlines described for them are that they shall be inferior to the supreme court and that they shall not exceed the specified limits of the federal judiciary whether their authority shall be original or appellate or both is not declared all this seems to be left to the discretion of the legislature and this being the case i perceive at present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the state courts to the subordinate national tribunals and many advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined it would diminish the motives to the multiplication of federal courts and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court the state tribunals may then be left with a more entire charge of federal causes and appeals in most cases in which they may be deemed proper instead of being carried to the supreme court may be made to lie from the state courts to district courts of the union publius 1 no 31 2 sec 8 art 1
